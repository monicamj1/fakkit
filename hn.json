      "text": "Two weeks ago, I woke up one morning with slightly blurry vision and a big, opaque, dark circle getting in the way of many things (especially if I close my right eye).  Visited the doctor and I&#x27;m told that I have macular degeneration in my right eye and a retina problem in my left eye.  It&#x27;s surprising because I&#x27;m not yet 40.  Doctor said I won&#x27;t go blind and prescribed me some medicine for an initial treatment.  I&#x27;m now looking into treatment options and researching this.  I am supposed to go back to the doctor soon for a checkup.  The dark circle has never left me; in fact, it&#x27;s now been joined by a transparent, shimmering circle.<p>I&#x27;m not worried about going blind based on the doctor&#x27;s opinion, but I am concerned that I will have to deal with long-term vision issues.  Currently, I cannot read the text on my screen if I close my right eye, as the dark circle gets in the way of everything.<p>It left me with an interesting question.  I&#x27;d read about blind people working as developers and sysadmins before.  But I never really thought about it, because my vision was so good.  I&#x27;m curious now, depending on how bad my eyes get, how would I transition so that I&#x27;d be able to continue my chosen profession?  Are there blind developers and sysadmins here who can toss a few resources my way?<p>Much appreciated to the HN community in advance, thanks.  I&#x27;m currently based in Asia, so about to sleep soon, hopefully I&#x27;ll wake up with a big load of comments to read.  ;)",
